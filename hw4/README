Prereuisites:
	For the Mapreduce:
		1. AWS CLI package (for configuring and running jobs on AWS)
		2. R
		3. Java
		4. Gradle
	For generating report:
		1. Kintr
		2. Pandoc: (apt-get install pandoc is not enough, need version 1.12.3 or up)
		3. Latex: sudo apt-get install texlive-full
		4. Fonts: sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended
		5. 'plyr' package for R

Running the code:
  EMR mode:
	1. Set environment variable MR_INPUT int the env.sh to the directory which contains the data files.
	2. Set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ,AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and BUCKET_NAME in the env.sh
	3. Run '. ./env.sh' to set the environment variables
	4. Use './run.sh -full-emr' to run the code.

Getting the Report:
	1. Report file will be created automatically during the process along with a pdf file named 'PricePredictions.pdf' contains all the plots. The report file name is 'report.pdf'. Also there is a sample report generated by cluster mode named 'generated_report.pdf' for reference. 
	2. Limitation of plots in the report. The size of plots in the report is not proper for reading. We not yet figure out a solution to this issue. Please refer to the plots in the 'PricePredictions.pdf' file.
	3. The MSE for all the regression is in mse.csv. You can rerun the calculation by running the 'test.R' R script after the EMR job is done.
