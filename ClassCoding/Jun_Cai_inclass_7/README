Fast-Query with Spark

Author: Jun Cai


How to run:
	* Copy 'Baseball' data to 'Indexing/'.
	* Build the index: './run.sh index'
	* Query: './run.sh query PLAYER_ID' where PLAYER_ID is the player ID you are interested in.
	* The query results will be in the console output.

Implementation:
	The Indexing program first reads and parse the 'batting.csv' file, build the index. The index is actually a HashMap which contains key-value pairs where the key is playerID and the value is a list of (yearID, teamID) tuples. 
	When doing a query, the index file is loaded into memory, then the given player ID is used to retrieve the (yearID, teamID) list from the HashMap.
