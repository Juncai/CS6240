Prereuisites:
	1. Our MapReduce implementation is memory intensive, when run in local mode try to configure the resource allocated for each child nodes. One useful setting is following property which should go to the 'mapred-site.xml' configuration file.

		<property>
			<name>mapred.child.java.opts</name>
			<value>-Xmx1024m</value>
		</property>

	2. AWS CLI package (for configuring and running jobs on AWS)
	3. Java
	4. Gradle
	7. Set environment variable MR_INPUT int the env.sh to the directory which contains the data files.
	8. Set data directories, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ,AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and BUCKET_NAME in the env.sh
	9. Source the environment variables by
		. env.sh
	10. Make sure the AWS CLI output format is configured to json.

Running the code:
	Prediction
		go into the 'Prediction' directory and run: ./run.sh
		The output will be in 'test/output' directory. Search 'TruePositive', 'TrueNegative', 'FalsePositive' and 'FalseNegative' in the output file to find the confusion matrix.
	Routing
		go into the 'Routing' directory and run: ./run.sh
		Since we only finish the training and prediction of this part, no query results are available.
