Prerequisits:
	1) Make sure you have the key-pair to create AWS EC2 instance, set the key pair name and private key file path in env.sh_template.

	2) Make sure to create your own security group. If you're launching a Windows instance, you must add a rule to "your-security-group" to allow inbound traffic on TCP port 3389 (RDP).If you're launching a Linux instance, you must add a rule to allow inbound traffic on TCP port 22 (SSH). Besides, don't forget to set the security group name in env.sh_template.
